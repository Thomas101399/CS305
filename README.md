Artemis Finacial is a US finance company that was looking for ways to improve security to protect important and private data. They wanted to add file verification to their system to ensure secure interactions between users. In addition, they wanted their application to compile with industry standards for security.

I believe that I did a good job of genereating a checksum to secure connections between users. In addition, I believe that the generations of the local certificate was also done well. Based off of the clients needs, I think choosing the AES256 and Sha-256 algorithms was a good choice. It is essential to code securely for the safety of the companys information and reputation. Coding securely constantly also allows for secure coding to come more natural and almost be second nature. 

The most challenging part of the project would have been picking the right algorithm for file security. The AES-256 was my choice but then I was unsure if I should use the same algorithm for the checksum. In addition, getting the certificate to allow secure access to the local lost was also challenging. I had to remake the certificate a few times and change the edit the allowed certificates on my computer a few times.

To add layers of security, I did a checksum verification, a secure connection on the server, and a cipher algorithm. Using the dependency check to find vulnerabilties is a good way to find which vulnerabilities to mitigate. In addition to this, manually inspecting code for vulnerabilites helps to provide a layer of security. 

Running dependency checks to see if new vulnerababilites arise after refactoring code is a good way to check if you added more vulnerabilties after refactoring. In addition, using alerts and error codes for the console also helps to find vulnerabilities. Running the application a fews times afterwards to ensure that it ran flawlessly everytime was also a way to make sure the code was functional. 

Dependency checks, securing https, creating certificates, and creating/deploying algorithms can all be used in future assignments in regards to security. Manually scanning code can also be super helpful in furture assignments

I would show them the certificate generation, the use of dependency checks, the securing of the local host https, and the generation of the checksum. I believe I did all of these well and it would show off my ability to create secure applications. This also allows them to see that I have some experience with cybersecurity and web security. I could also show the cipher algorithm, which shows them that I can encrypt within java.
